# A Biology-Inspired Board Game with an AI Opponent

The game is written primarily in plain JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.  

The only external library used is [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/),
which is used to add retro soundeffects.

The scoring cell annimation and statistics graphics were done using HTML canvases.  

The cell design was done using base R graphics. 

The AI opponent is greedy with respect to some scoring metric.
